    1. **Seasonal Variability**: Bike usage peaks during warmer months (Mayâ€“October) and drops significantly in colder months, driven by temperature variations. This seasonal demand surge likely leads to complaints about bike unavailability.
    2. **High-Demand Stations**: Specific stations in central and lower Manhattan, such as W 21 St & 6 Ave, West St & Chambers St, and Broadway & W 58 St, dominate usage. However, this high concentration of activity creates imbalances in supply and demand.
    3. **Uneven Regional Activity**: Peripheral areas, such as northern Manhattan and some outer boroughs, show lower activity, indicating underutilization of resources.
    4. **Regional Connectivity**: Significant travel links between Manhattan, Jersey City, and Brooklyn emphasize the need for better infrastructure and bike management across these hubs.
    5. **Redistribution Gaps**: Current operational strategies may not sufficiently address the variability in demand, especially during peak seasons and at high-traffic stations.
